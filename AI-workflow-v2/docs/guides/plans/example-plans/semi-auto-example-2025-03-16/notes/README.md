# Notes Directory

This directory contains notes and references related to the weather API integration implementation.

Example notes would include:
- Weather API selection considerations
- API key management approaches
- Data model design decisions
- Component design alternatives
- Testing strategies for API integrations
- Performance considerations
- Weather data visualization best practices

For a real implementation, this directory would contain notes on key decisions and references that informed the implementation approach.
