## Status Log

*   **[Timestamp]** - Phase: VERIFICATION - Successfully tested login, signup, and logout flows. Resolved routing issues by correcting `app/routes.ts` to use `flatRoutes` and reverting `app/entry.server.tsx` to manual rendering with `ServerRouter`. Authentication core functionality is verified.

*   **[Timestamp]** - Phase: VERIFICATION - Successfully tested login, signup, and logout flows. Routing issues resolved.
*   **[Timestamp]** - Phase: IMPLEMENTATION - User approved deployment configuration & instructions checkpoint (Task 9.4).
*   **[Timestamp]** - Phase: IMPLEMENTATION - Added Stripe Elements Provider and CardElement placeholder to checkout route.
*   **[Timestamp]** - Phase: IMPLEMENTATION - Created basic checkout route structure and loader.
*   **[Timestamp]** - Phase: IMPLEMENTATION - Implemented cart session management using KV storage.
*   **[Timestamp]** - Phase: IMPLEMENTATION - Refactored context access in loaders/actions.

## Current Status

*   **Phase:** COMPLETION (PRD Phase 1 Scope)
*   **Mode:** @mode:manual
*   **Progress:** PRD Phase 1 Implementation Plan Completed.
*   **Next:** Plan next phase or feature implementation.

## Known Issues / Areas for Improvement (Post Phase 1)

*   **Chakra UI Imports:** Intermittent import/linter errors for Chakra components (`Box`, `Heading`, `Table`, etc.) in various routes. Required using basic HTML placeholders in some areas. Needs investigation (Vite/SSR/Chakra interaction?).
*   **Cart Query Refactoring:** Functions like `getCartById` still rely on passing a reconstructed context object due to dependencies. Should be refactored to accept `db` and `storeId` directly.
*   **Context Type Definition:** The `AppLoadContext` is now centralized in `app/types/context.ts`, but callers sometimes use `context as AppLoadContext` which could be safer with the `isAppContext` type guard.
*   **Server-Side User Sessions:** Task 4.8 (linking server sessions to `userId` after login) was postponed.
*   **Automated Testing:** No unit or integration tests implemented.
*   **UI Placeholders:** Admin and Storefront UIs are basic HTML placeholders.
*   **Error Handling:** Basic console logging and simple error messages; needs refinement.
