# Implementation Plans

This directory contains implementation plans created using the AI Workflow Framework.

Implementation plans define the scope, steps, and requirements for specific tasks or features being implemented using the AI assistant. Each plan is stored in its own subdirectory with the naming convention:

```
plan-[descriptive-name]-[YYYY-MM-DD]/
```

## Directory Structure

Each plan directory follows a standard structure:

```
plan-name-date/
├── README.md                # Plan overview and summary
├── implementation/          # Implementation details and execution
│   ├── plan.md              # The implementation plan
│   └── status.md            # Current status and progress
├── artifacts/               # Generated outputs during implementation
├── evaluation/              # Testing and verification information
