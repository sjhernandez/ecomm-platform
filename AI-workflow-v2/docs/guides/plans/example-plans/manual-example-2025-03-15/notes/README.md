# Notes Directory

This directory contains supplementary notes and reference materials related to the user authentication system implementation.

Example notes would include:
- Meeting notes
- Decision logs
- Research findings
- References to external resources
- Alternative approaches considered
- Implementation challenges and solutions
- Lessons learned

For a real implementation, this directory would be populated with various notes collected throughout the implementation process.
