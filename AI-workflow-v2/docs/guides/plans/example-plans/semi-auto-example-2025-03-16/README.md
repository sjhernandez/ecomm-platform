# Weather API Integration Implementation Plan - Semi-Automatic Mode Example

This directory contains an example implementation plan using semi-automatic mode (@mode:semi) for implementing a weather API integration. The example demonstrates the balanced approach between oversight and efficiency that characterizes semi-automatic mode implementation plans.

## Directory Contents

- **README.md**: This overview document
- **[plan.md](plan.md)**: The detailed implementation plan for the weather API integration

## Implementation Overview

This example demonstrates how to implement a third-party weather API integration with the following components:

1. **API Client**: Service for communicating with the weather API
2. **Data Models**: Structured models for API response data
3. **Weather Widget**: Component to display current weather conditions
4. **Forecast Display**: Component to display multi-day forecast

The implementation plan follows the semi-automatic mode approach, which provides:

- Component-level verification with key approval points
- Balanced implementation guidance
- Efficient progress tracking
- Focused documentation
- Clear resumption points

## Key Characteristics of Semi-Automatic Mode

This example showcases the following semi-automatic mode characteristics:

1. **Component-Level Tracking**: Progress tracking at the component level
2. **Key Verification Points**: Verification focused on major components
3. **Balanced Documentation**: Sufficient but not excessive documentation
4. **Phase Checkpoints**: Verification at the end of major phases
5. **Resume Information**: Clear resumption points for continuing work
6. **Implementation Log**: Chronological record of key actions
7. **Lessons Learned**: Continuous capture of insights and improvements

## Learning from this Example

This example can help you understand:

1. How to structure a semi-automatic mode implementation plan
2. Best practices for implementing API integrations
3. How to organize code for third-party services
4. How to create effective data models for API responses
5. How to track progress at the component level
6. How to create resumption points for long-running implementations

## When to Use Semi-Automatic Mode

Consider using semi-automatic mode, as demonstrated in this example, when:

- Implementing moderately complex integrations
- Working with third-party APIs
- Balancing efficiency and oversight
- Working in staging or development environments
- When key verification points are sufficient for quality assurance

## Usage Examples

To use this example as a reference for your own API integration:

1. Review the [plan.md](plan.md) file to understand the structure and approach
2. Note the organization of the implementation into logical phases
3. Study the data model approach for handling API responses
4. Adapt the component structure to your specific API integration
