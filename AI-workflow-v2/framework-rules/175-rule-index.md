# AI Workflow Framework Centralized Rule Index

This document serves as the master reference for all components of the AI Workflow Framework, including newly consolidated documents with step numbering for improved tracking and reference.

## Core Categories

| Category | Description | Components | Primary Application |
|----|----|---|---|
| Core | Essential framework processes | Implementation Process, Mode Standards, State Management | All implementations |
| Protection | Safety and boundary controls | Scope Control, Production Safeguards, Refactoring Controls, Component Integrity Protection | Safety-critical changes |
| Verification | Quality and validation controls | Quality Assurance, Documentation Standards, Progress Tracking | All implementations |
| Enforcement | Compliance mechanisms | Checklist Enforcement, Human Checkpoints, Adaptive Pre-Flight Checks | All implementations |

## Consolidated Documents

The following documents have been consolidated with step numbering for improved tracking and reference:

### 105-checklist-system.md

Consolidates checklist systems from:
- 105-checklist-template-system.md (now consolidated)
- 126-checklist-mode-standards.md (now consolidated)

### 125-mode-implementation-standards.md

Consolidates all mode-specific requirements from:
- 125-mode-selection.md (now deprecated)
- 100-implementation-process.md (sections preserved)
- 200-scope-control.md (sections preserved)
- 275-component-boundary-protection.md (sections preserved)
- Multiple other documents with mode-specific sections

### 150-implementation-state-management.md

Consolidates state management and progress tracking from:
- 150-context-management.md (now deprecated) 
- 350-progress-tracking.md (now deprecated)

### 275-component-integrity-protection.md

Consolidates component protection and verification from:
- 275-component-boundary-protection.md (now deprecated)
- 325-component-snapshot-verification.md (now deprecated)

### 450-adaptive-pre-flight-checks.md

Consolidates pre-flight verification systems from:
- 450-pre-flight-checks.md (now deprecated)
- 455-refactoring-pre-flight-checks.md (now deprecated)

## Application Guidance

To apply the updated framework:

1. Use the Mode Implementation Standards (125) to determine mode-specific requirements
2. Follow the Implementation Process (100) for overall workflow
3. Apply the Implementation State Management System (150) for tracking progress and maintaining context
4. Use Adaptive Pre-Flight Checks (450) before any critical operations
5. Apply Component Integrity Protection (275) when working with protected components
6. Follow the Documentation Standards (325) for consistent documentation
7. Use Human Checkpoints (425) for critical approval points
8. Apply Checklist Enforcement (400) throughout implementation, identifying relevant checklists from `checklists/` based on context and Rule 105.

## Backwards Compatibility

All consolidated documents maintain backwards compatibility through:

1. Reference mapping sections connecting old and new section numbers
2. Deprecated documents that redirect to the new consolidated versions
3. Preservation of all original requirements in the consolidated documents
4. Consistent rule numbering for primary categories
5. Transparent document status indicators

## Implementation Note

This rule index is CONTINUOUSLY UPDATED as framework components evolve. Always refer to the latest version for the most current information.
