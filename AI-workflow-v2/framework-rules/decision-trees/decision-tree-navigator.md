# Decision Navigator

## Overview

This Decision Navigator serves as the central entry point for all decision-making processes in the AI Workflow Framework. It directs you to the appropriate decision domain based on your current implementation context and specific decision needs.

## 1. Decision Context Assessment

1.1. Determine current implementation phase:
