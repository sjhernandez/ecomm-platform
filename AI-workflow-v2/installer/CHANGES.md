# AI Workflow Installer Improvements (v2.0.0)

This document outlines the improvements made to the AI Workflow installer script to simplify the installation process and make it more reliable.

## Key Changes

1. **Simplified Workspace Copying**:
   - Removed complex "protected directories" logic
   - Implemented clearer install vs. update distinction
   - Full copy for clean installs, non-destructive updates for existing installations

2. **Clearer User Communication**:
   - Added explicit warnings for clean installations
   - Better success messages with accurate counts
   - More informative logging throughout the process

3. **Streamlined Implementation**:
   - Simplified workspace directory handling
   - Removed redundant checks and logic
   - Improved error handling with clearer messages

4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - Maintained consistent path handling for Windows and macOS
   - Normalized paths to ensure correct behavior
   - Used relative paths correctly for better cross-platform support

5. **Enhanced AI Assistance**:
   - Cursor rules always updated to latest version
   - Framework rule conversion is fully automated
   - Workspace files remain protected by default

6. **Improved Subdirectory Protection**:
   - Fixed handling of deeply nested directories
   - Enhanced preservation of user files in all subdirectories
   - Better error handling for directory operations
   - Increased recursion depth for deeply nested structures

7. **Smart Force Refresh**:
   - Completely redesigned force refresh to preserve custom content
   - Added auto-detection of custom user directories
   - Selectively refreshes only standard framework files
   - Special protection for repository profiles and custom rules
   - Clear indicators of protected content during installation

## Technical Changes

### Force Refresh Improvements

Completely redesigned the force refresh mechanism to:
- Never delete custom user content
- Automatically detect custom directories and files
- Selectively delete only default framework files
- Add special protection markers for important user directories
- Provide clear visual indicators of protected content
- Preserve all custom content, even with --force-refresh flag

### copyWorkspaceToRoot Function

Completely rewrote the function to:
- Explicitly handle clean installs vs. updates
- Use simpler logic for each case
- Properly handle directory creation
- Provide accurate status reporting
- NEVER overwrite existing customer files unless explicitly told to with --update
- Preserve files in all subdirectories, including deeply nested ones
- Detect and mark user-customized directories for extra protection

### getAllFiles Function

Enhanced to:
- Properly handle deeply nested directory structures
- Increase recursion depth limits
- Add special debug information for important directories
- Improve error handling for directory access issues

### copyRulesToCursor Function

Modified to:
- Always update Cursor rules to the latest version
- Ensure optimal AI assistance by keeping rules current
- Provide clear messaging about rule updates

### isInProtectedDirectory Function

Simplified to:
- No longer protect workspace-related paths
- Focus on system directories that should never be modified
- Support the separation of workspace copying logic

### Protected Directories List

Updated to only include truly protected system directories:
- .git
- .cursor
- node_modules

### copyExamplePlans Function

Simplified since example plans are now included in the workspace copy.

## Testing

The updated installer has been tested on:
- macOS
- Windows 10
- Linux (Ubuntu)

With both clean installs and updates, verifying that:
- Clean installs correctly copy all files
- Updates preserve existing files while adding new ones
- Force refresh preserves custom content while updating framework files
- All essential directories are created
- Cross-platform path handling works correctly
- Cursor rules are always updated to latest version
- Deeply nested customer files in subdirectories are preserved
- Custom content in special directories is never deleted

## Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: Code is easier to understand and maintain
2. **Reliability**: More predictable behavior with fewer edge cases
3. **User Experience**: Clearer messaging and expectations
4. **Performance**: More efficient implementation with less redundant work
5. **AI Assistance**: Always up-to-date with latest framework guidance
6. **Data Protection**: Stronger safeguards for nested customer content
7. **Update Safety**: Smart force refresh that preserves important user content
