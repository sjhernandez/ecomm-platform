# Implementation Outputs

This directory contains outputs and artifacts generated during the implementation of plans using the AI Workflow Framework.

## Purpose

The outputs directory provides a centralized location for storing artifacts that are created as part of implementing plans, but which are not part of the plan documentation itself. This includes:

- Generated code files
- Documentation drafts
- Diagrams and visual assets
- Configuration files
- Exported data

## Organization

Outputs should be organized in subdirectories corresponding to the implementation plan that created them:

```
outputs/
├── [plan-name-date]/
│   ├── code/
│   ├── documentation/
│   └── other-artifacts/
```

## Usage Guidelines

1. Store only final or significant outputs (not temporary or intermediate files)
2. Include a README.md in each subdirectory explaining the contents
3. Use appropriate naming conventions and file organization
4. Reference these outputs in plan documentation when relevant
