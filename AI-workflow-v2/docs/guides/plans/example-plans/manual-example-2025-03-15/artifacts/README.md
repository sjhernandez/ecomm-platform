# Artifacts Directory

This directory contains artifacts generated during the implementation of the user authentication system.

Example artifacts would include:
- Generated code snippets
- Component diagrams
- Authentication flow diagrams
- API documentation
- Test results
- Security review reports

For a real implementation, this directory would be populated with actual artifacts as they are created during the implementation process.
