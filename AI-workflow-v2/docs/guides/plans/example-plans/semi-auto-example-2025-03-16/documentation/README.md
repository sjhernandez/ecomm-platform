# Documentation Directory

This directory contains documentation related to the weather API integration implementation.

Example documentation would include:
- API integration guide
- Weather data model documentation
- Component usage documentation
- API reference
- Weather widget usage guide
- Forecast display configuration options
- Integration troubleshooting guide

For a real implementation, this directory would be populated with focused documentation covering the key aspects of the weather API integration.
