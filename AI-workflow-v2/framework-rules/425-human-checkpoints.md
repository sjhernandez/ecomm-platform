# Human Checkpoint Protocol

This protocol establishes a system of human checkpoints for AI workflow implementations to ensure human oversight, explicit approval, and implementation transparency at critical points.

## Human Checkpoint Requirements
*   Explicit human approval should be obtained.
*   Complete transparency should be provided.
*   Critical decisions should be validated.
*   Approval should be documented.
*   Proceeding without approval is prohibited.
*   Do not assume implied approval.

## Required Human Checkpoint Stages

*(Guidance on determining when checkpoints are required based on context, mode, and risk can be found in the [Human Checkpoint Decision Tree](AI-workflow-v2/framework-rules/decision-trees/decision-tree-planning-domain.md#6).)*

Human checkpoints are REQUIRED at these stages:

### 1. Phase Transitions
- Between implementation process phases
- REQUIRES formal phase completion approval
- CRITICAL enforcement point

### 2. Critical Decision Points
- When making significant implementation decisions
- REQUIRES explicit decision approval
- HIGH enforcement priority

### 3. Implementation Milestones
- At completion of major implementation components
- REQUIRES milestone verification
- STANDARD enforcement priority

### 4. Scope Boundary Cases
- When approaching or potentially exceeding scope
- REQUIRES explicit scope exception approval
- CRITICAL enforcement priority

### 5. Risk Mitigation Points
- Before high-risk operations
- REQUIRES risk acknowledgment
- HIGH enforcement priority

### 6. Verification Gates
- After implementation verification
- REQUIRES quality approval
- STANDARD enforcement priority

## Human Checkpoint Format

Checkpoints should follow this format:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ HUMAN CHECKPOINT: [checkpoint type]                │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ CURRENT STATE:                                     │
│ - Implementation Phase: [phase]                    │
│ - Progress: [progress percentage]                  │
│ - Current Status: [status description]             │
│                                                    │
│ CHECKPOINT PURPOSE:                                │
│ [Clear explanation of why approval is needed]      │
│                                                    │
│ APPROVAL REQUEST:                                  │
│ [Specific request requiring explicit response]     │
│                                                    │
│ OPTIONS:                                           │
│ 1. APPROVE: [implications of approval]             │
│ 2. REJECT: [implications of rejection]             │
│ 3. MODIFY: [modification instructions]             │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Mode-Specific Requirements

Refer to **Rule 125 (Mode Implementation Standards), Sections 2 and 5** for mode-specific requirements regarding checkpoint frequency, information detail, and required approval levels.

## Checkpoint Response Requirements

Human responses should be:

1. **EXPLICIT** - Clear approval/rejection
2. **SPECIFIC** - Addresses checkpoint request
3. **ACTIONABLE** - Provides implementation guidance
4. **DOCUMENTED** - Recorded in implementation history

## Proceeding After Checkpoints

After a human checkpoint:
*   ACKNOWLEDGE the response received
*   DOCUMENT the approval/rejection
*   IMPLEMENT any modifications requested
*   VERIFY understanding of guidance
*   PROCEED ONLY if explicitly approved

## Checkpoint Documentation

Checkpoints should be documented:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CHECKPOINT DOCUMENTATION                           │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ CHECKPOINT ID: [identifier]                        │
│ TYPE: [checkpoint type]                            │
│ TIMESTAMP: [date/time]                             │
│ REQUEST: [approval requested]                      │
│ RESPONSE: [human response]                         │
│ OUTCOME: [approved/rejected/modified]              │
│ IMPLEMENTATION: [actions taken]                    │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Enforcement Implementation

This human checkpoint protocol is enforced through:

1. **Workflow Integration** - Checkpoints integrated into process
2. **Documentation Requirements** - Required approval documentation
3. **Halt-and-Wait Mechanism** - Process halts until approval
4. **Checkpoint Registry** - Records of all checkpoints
5. **State Transparency** - Complete visibility of implementation state

## Human Checkpoint Verification

Use the standard verification statement format from Rule 100, with:

```
I have applied the Human Checkpoint Protocol (425) requirements following the @mode:[mode] standards, verified all necessary elements, and ensured compliance with the framework.
```
