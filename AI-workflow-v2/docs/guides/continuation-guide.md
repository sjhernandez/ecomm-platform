# Guide: Requesting Implementation Continuation

If an implementation task needs to be continued from a previous session (e.g., due to context limits or interruptions), use the following structure to provide the necessary context to the new AI assistant instance.

Providing this information helps the AI reconstruct the state and resume work efficiently, minimizing the need for extensive re-reading of logs or code.

```markdown
# Implementation Continuation Request

**Intent:** Please continue the implementation for the following plan.

**Plan ID:** [Unique ID of the plan, e.g., optimize-framework-rules-001]

**Plan Location:** `ai-workflow-workspace/plans/[plan-id]/` 
(Confirm the plan directory with `plan.md` and `status.md` exists here)

**Previous Session Summary (Optional but helpful):**
[Briefly summarize the goal or last major action of the previous session]

**Current State (from last known `status.md` or Handover Doc):**
*   **Last Known Phase:** [e.g., Implementation (Phase 2)]
*   **Last Known Step:** [e.g., Task 2.1]
*   **Last Known Status:** [e.g., Completed Task 2.1]
*   **Last Known Progress:** [e.g., 60%]

**Handover Document (If available):**
[Paste the full content of the handover document generated by the previous AI instance here, if one was created]

**Key Files to Review:**
*   `ai-workflow-workspace/plans/[plan-id]/plan.md`
*   `ai-workflow-workspace/plans/[plan-id]/status.md` (most recent state)
*   `ai-workflow-workspace/plans/[plan-id]/README.md`
*   *(Optionally mention any specific code files modified recently)*

**Next Action Required:**
[Based on the last known status, specify the next logical step, e.g., "Proceed with Task 2.2 as defined in plan.md"] 
```

**Instructions for AI:**

When you receive a continuation request:

1.  Locate the specified plan directory (`ai-workflow-workspace/plans/[plan-id]/`).
2.  Carefully review the provided context, especially the `plan.md` and the latest entries in `status.md`.
3.  If a Handover Document is provided, prioritize its information for state reconstruction (as per Rule 150).
4.  Reconstruct the implementation state (Phase, Step, Progress, Scope, Mode, Decisions, etc.).
5.  Confirm your understanding and the next step you will take.
6.  Generate an updated context header.
7.  Proceed with the requested next action.
