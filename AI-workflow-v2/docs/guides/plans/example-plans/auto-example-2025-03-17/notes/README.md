# Notes Directory

This directory contains brief notes related to the pagination component implementation.

Example notes would include:
- Design pattern references
- Component library references
- Accessibility guidelines
- Styling approaches
- Testing strategies
- Performance optimization notes
- Browser compatibility considerations

For a real implementation, this directory would contain minimal but essential notes that informed the pagination component implementation approach.
