# Task Status Board

**Purpose:** Tracks task status for parallel implementation coordination.
**Protocol:** Before starting work, check board for `PENDING` tasks with met dependencies. Update task status to `IN_PROGRESS` when starting, `BLOCKED` if dependencies unmet, and `COMPLETE` when finished and verified.

## Status Definitions

*   `PENDING`: Ready to start (dependencies met).
*   `IN_PROGRESS`: Actively being worked on.
*   `BLOCKED`: Cannot proceed (dependencies unmet).
*   `COMPLETE`: Finished and verified.
