# Documentation Directory

This directory contains streamlined documentation related to the pagination component implementation.

Example documentation would include:
- Component API reference
- Props documentation
- Usage examples
- Accessibility features
- Styling options
- Integration guide
- Performance considerations

For a real implementation, this directory would be populated with concise, focused documentation covering the essential aspects of the pagination component.
