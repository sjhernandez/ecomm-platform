# Artifacts Directory

This directory contains artifacts generated during the implementation of the weather API integration.

Example artifacts would include:
- Generated API client code
- Data model schemas
- Component wireframes
- API response examples
- Weather widget mockups
- Forecast display prototype
- Integration test results

For a real implementation, this directory would be populated with actual artifacts as they are created during the implementation process.
