# Artifacts Directory

This directory contains artifacts generated during the implementation of the pagination component.

Example artifacts would include:
- Component code
- CSS/styling code
- Test code
- Component screenshots
- UI design mockups
- Component demos
- Test coverage reports

For a real implementation, this directory would be populated with concise artifacts focused on the pagination component implementation.
