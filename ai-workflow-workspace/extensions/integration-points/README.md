# Integration Points

This directory contains Integration Points for the AI Workflow Framework, which allow the framework to integrate with external tools, systems, and workflows. Integration points provide standardized ways to connect the framework with other components of your development environment.

## What are Integration Points?

Integration points are configuration files and scripts that enable the AI Workflow Framework to interact with external tools and systems. They allow you to:

- **Connect** the framework with version control systems
- **Integrate** with project management tools
- **Extend** the framework with custom tooling
- **Adapt** the framework to specific environments or workflows

## Integration Types

The framework supports several types of integrations:

1. **Version Control Integrations**: Connect the framework with Git, SVN, or other version control systems
2. **Project Management Integrations**: Connect with JIRA, Trello, GitHub Issues, or other project management tools
3. **CI/CD Integrations**: Connect with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or other CI/CD pipelines
4. **IDE Integrations**: Connect with various IDEs beyond Cursor
5. **Custom Tool Integrations**: Connect with custom tools or scripts

## Directory Structure

```
integration-points/
├── README.md - This overview document
├── integration-template.md - Template for creating new integrations
└── [integration-name].md - Individual integration configurations
```

Integration points can also be part of repository profiles in the `repository-profiles/[repository-name]/integrations/` directory.

## Creating an Integration Point

To create a new integration point:

1. Copy the `integration-template.md` file to `integration-points/[integration-name].md`
2. Specify the integration type and configuration
3. Customize the integration details as needed
4. Specify activation settings and requirements

## Using Integration Points

To use an integration point:

1. Ensure the integration is available in the `integration-points/` directory
2. Ensure any required external tools or systems are available
3. Activate the integration using the `@integration:activate [integration-name]` command
4. The framework will automatically configure and apply the integration

If the integration is part of a repository profile, it will be activated automatically when the profile is activated.

## Integration Point Format

Each integration point follows this format:

```

version: "[integration version]"
status: "Active"
integration_type: "[vcs/pm/cicd/ide/custom]"

## Version Control Integrations

Version control integrations connect the framework with Git, SVN, or other version control systems. They allow the framework to:

- **Access** repository information
- **Track** changes in version control
- **Generate** appropriate commit messages
- **Manage** branches and pull requests

Example version control integration:

```
---
type: "integration-point"
integration_name: "github-integration"
description: "Integrates the framework with GitHub for repository information and operations"
version: "1.0"
status: "Active"
integration_type: "vcs"
target_system: "GitHub"
requirements: [
  "git",
  "GitHub CLI (gh)"
]
configuration: {
  "use_conventional_commits": true,
  "auto_create_pull_requests": false,
  "branch_prefix": "ai-workflow/"
}

# GitHub Integration

This integration connects the AI Workflow Framework with GitHub repositories, enabling automated repository information retrieval and commit message generation.

## Setup

1. Ensure Git is installed and configured
2. Install GitHub CLI (gh) and authenticate
3. Configure GitHub-specific settings in the integration configuration

## Features

- **Repository Information**: Automatically retrieves repository structure, branches, and issues
- **Commit Message Generation**: Generates conventional commit messages based on changes
- **Branch Management**: Creates feature branches with consistent naming
- **Pull Request Generation**: Optionally creates pull requests for completed implementations

## Usage

## Project Management Integrations

Project management integrations connect the framework with JIRA, Trello, GitHub Issues, or other project management tools. They allow the framework to:

- **Track** implementation tasks in project management systems
- **Update** task status as implementation progresses
- **Link** implementations to specific issues or tasks
- **Generate** documentation tied to project items

Example project management integration:

```
---
type: "integration-point"
integration_name: "jira-integration"
description: "Integrates the framework with JIRA for task tracking and management"
version: "1.0"
status: "Active"
integration_type: "pm"
target_system: "JIRA"
requirements: [
  "JIRA CLI or API access",
  "JIRA credentials"
]
configuration: {
  "jira_base_url": "https://company.atlassian.net",
  "auto_update_tickets": true,
  "status_mapping": {
    "in_progress": "In Progress",
    "completed": "Done",
    "blocked": "Blocked"
  }
}

# JIRA Integration

This integration connects the AI Workflow Framework with JIRA, enabling automated task tracking and status updates.

## Setup

1. Configure JIRA access credentials
2. Set up status mappings for your JIRA workflow
3. Enable the integration in your implementation requests

## Features

- **Task Linking**: Associates implementations with specific JIRA tickets
- **Status Updates**: Automatically updates ticket status based on implementation progress
- **Comment Generation**: Adds implementation details as comments to tickets
- **Time Tracking**: Optionally logs time spent on implementations

## Usage

## CI/CD Integrations

CI/CD integrations connect the framework with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or other CI/CD pipelines. They allow the framework to:

- **Trigger** CI/CD pipelines for testing and deployment
- **Monitor** pipeline status and results
- **Incorporate** test results into implementations
- **Automate** deployment of implementations

## IDE Integrations

IDE integrations connect the framework with various IDEs beyond Cursor. They allow the framework to:

- **Adapt** to IDE-specific features and limitations
- **Generate** IDE-specific configurations
- **Modify** workflow behavior based on the IDE environment
- **Leverage** IDE-specific tools and capabilities

## Custom Tool Integrations

Custom tool integrations connect the framework with custom tools or scripts. They allow the framework to:

- **Incorporate** custom tooling into the workflow
- **Automate** repository-specific processes
- **Extend** the framework with specialized capabilities
- **Adapt** to unique development environments

## Integration Activation Process

When an integration point is activated, the framework:

1. **Loads the integration configuration** - Reading and parsing the integration file
2. **Verifies requirements** - Checking if required tools and systems are available
3. **Configures the integration** - Setting up the connection with the external system
4. **Applies the integration** - Incorporating the integration into the framework's behavior

## Best Practices for Integrations

### Integration Scope

- Keep integrations focused on specific systems or tools
- Clearly define the scope and purpose of each integration
- Avoid overly complex integrations that try to do too much
- Document requirements and dependencies thoroughly

### Integration Security

- Store sensitive information securely
- Use environment variables for credentials
- Avoid hardcoding tokens or passwords
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### Integration Testing

- Test integrations thoroughly before deployment
- Verify that integrations work in all relevant environments
- Document known limitations or issues
- Update integrations when external systems change
