# User Authentication System Implementation Plan - Manual Mode Example

This directory contains an example implementation plan using manual mode (@mode:manual) for implementing a user authentication system. The example demonstrates the high level of oversight and verification that characterizes manual mode implementation plans.

## Directory Contents

- **README.md**: This overview document
- **[plan.md](plan.md)**: The detailed implementation plan for the user authentication system

## Implementation Overview

This example demonstrates how to implement a complete user authentication system with the following features:

1. **User Login**: Secure login functionality with validation and error handling
2. **User Registration**: New user registration with email verification
3. **Password Reset**: Secure password reset functionality
4. **Profile Management**: User profile features including password change

The implementation plan follows the manual mode approach, which provides:

- Step-by-step verification with explicit approval points
- Comprehensive documentation requirements
- Detailed implementation logs
- Thorough security review process
- Complete rollback procedures

## Key Characteristics of Manual Mode

This example showcases the following manual mode characteristics:

1. **Detailed Status Tracking**: Comprehensive progress tracking with visual indicators
2. **Explicit Verification Points**: Clear verification criteria for each step
3. **Thorough Documentation**: Complete documentation at each step
4. **Security Focus**: Dedicated security review steps
5. **User Acceptance Testing**: Explicit user testing phase
6. **Complete Implementation Log**: Detailed chronological record of all actions
7. **Phase Checkpoints**: Formal verification at the end of each phase

## Learning from this Example

This example can help you understand:

1. How to structure a manual mode implementation plan
2. Best practices for implementing authentication systems
3. How to document security-related implementations
4. How to track progress effectively in critical implementations
5. How to establish clear verification criteria
6. How to organize implementation steps into logical phases

## When to Use Manual Mode

Consider using manual mode, as demonstrated in this example, when:

- Implementing security-critical features like authentication
- Working on components that handle sensitive user data
- Working in production environments
- Implementing features with regulatory compliance requirements
- When maximum oversight and verification are required

## Usage Examples

To use this example as a reference for your own authentication implementation:

1. Review the [plan.md](plan.md) file to understand the structure and approach
2. Note the level of detail in the verification steps and security reviews
3. Use the phase organization as a template for your implementation
4. Adapt the implementation steps to your specific authentication requirements
