# Pagination Component Implementation Plan - Automatic Mode Example

This directory contains an example implementation plan using automatic mode (@mode:auto) for implementing a pagination component. The example demonstrates the streamlined approach for rapid implementation that characterizes automatic mode implementation plans.

## Directory Contents

- **README.md**: This overview document
- **[plan.md](plan.md)**: The detailed implementation plan for the pagination component

## Implementation Overview

This example demonstrates how to implement a reusable pagination component with the following features:

1. **Page Navigation**: Controls for navigating between pages
2. **Items Per Page**: Customizable items per page
3. **Responsive Design**: Component works on all screen sizes
4. **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

The implementation plan follows the automatic mode approach, which provides:

- High-level implementation guidance
- Minimal approval requirements
- Streamlined documentation
- Outcome-focused verification
- Rapid implementation process

## Key Characteristics of Automatic Mode

This example showcases the following automatic mode characteristics:

1. **Simplified Structure**: Streamlined plan organization
2. **Technical Specifications**: Detailed component specifications
3. **Outcome-Focused Verification**: Focus on final outcome rather than steps
4. **Minimal Approval Points**: Reduced oversight for faster implementation
5. **Implementation Approach**: Clear guidance without excessive detail
6. **Verification Criteria**: Concise success criteria

## Learning from this Example

This example can help you understand:

1. How to structure an automatic mode implementation plan
2. Best practices for implementing UI components
3. How to define component props and default values
4. How to set clear verification criteria
5. How to organize implementation in phases
6. How to provide technical specifications for implementation

## When to Use Automatic Mode

Consider using automatic mode, as demonstrated in this example, when:

- Implementing UI components or utilities
- Working on low-risk, well-understood features
- Prioritizing speed of implementation
- Working in development environments
- Implementing features with established patterns
- When minimal oversight is acceptable

## Usage Examples

To use this example as a reference for your own UI component implementation:

1. Review the [plan.md](plan.md) file to understand the structure and approach
2. Study the technical specifications section for component definition
3. Note the verification criteria for clear success metrics
4. Adapt the implementation phases to your specific component
