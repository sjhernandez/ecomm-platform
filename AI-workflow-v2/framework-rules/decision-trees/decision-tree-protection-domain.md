# Protection Domain

## Overview

The Protection Domain consolidates all decision trees related to establishing and enforcing protection mechanisms. This includes determining protection levels, assigning component-specific protection, defining scope boundaries, and implementing change safety controls.

## 1. Protection Level Determination

1.1. Environment-Based Protection Level:
   - Production Environment [ENV-PROD] → Maximum Protection (Level 4) [ref: decision-tree-standard-factors.md#1.1]
   - Staging Environment [ENV-STAGE] → High Protection (Level 3) [ref: decision-tree-standard-factors.md#1.2]
   - Development Environment [ENV-DEV] → Standard Protection (Level 2) [ref: decision-tree-standard-factors.md#1.3]
   - Local Development → Basic Protection (Level 1)

1.2. Data Sensitivity Protection Adjustment:
   - Highly Sensitive Data [DATA-HIGH] → Increase protection level by 1 (Maximum 4) [ref: decision-tree-standard-factors.md#6.1]
   - Business Sensitive Data [DATA-BUS] → Consider increasing protection level [ref: decision-tree-standard-factors.md#6.2]
   - Internal Data [DATA-INT] → Standard protection level [ref: decision-tree-standard-factors.md#6.3]
   - Public Data [DATA-PUB] → May decrease protection level by 1 (Minimum 1) [ref: decision-tree-standard-factors.md#6.4]

1.3. Risk-Based Protection Adjustment:
   - Critical Risk [RISK-CRIT] → Maximum Protection (Level 4) [ref: decision-tree-standard-factors.md#3.1]
   - High Risk [RISK-HIGH] → At least High Protection (Level 3+) [ref: decision-tree-standard-factors.md#3.2]
   - Medium Risk [RISK-MED] → At least Standard Protection (Level 2+) [ref: decision-tree-standard-factors.md#3.3]
   - Low Risk [RISK-LOW] → Basic Protection (Level 1) may be sufficient [ref: decision-tree-standard-factors.md#3.4]

1.4. Component-Based Additional Protection:
   - Critical Component [COMP-CRIT] → Add component-specific protection (@LOCKED or @INTERFACE) [ref: decision-tree-standard-factors.md#4.1]
   - Standard Component [COMP-STD] → Consider component-specific protection (@BEHAVIOR or @INTERFACE) [ref: decision-tree-standard-factors.md#4.2]
   - Auxiliary Component [COMP-AUX] → Basic protection usually sufficient (@FLEXIBLE) [ref: decision-tree-standard-factors.md#4.3]

### Protection Level Decision Process

```
DECISION [D-PROT-1]: What protection level is required?

FACTORS:
- Environment Type: [Evaluate based on decision-tree-standard-factors.md#1]
- Data Sensitivity: [Evaluate based on decision-tree-standard-factors.md#6]
- Risk Level: [Evaluate based on decision-tree-standard-factors.md#3]
- Component Type: [Evaluate based on decision-tree-standard-factors.md#4]

PROCESS:
1. Start with Environment-Based Protection Level (1.1)
2. Apply Data Sensitivity Adjustment (1.2)
3. Apply Risk-Based Protection Adjustment (1.3)
4. Consider Component-Specific Protection (1.4)
5. Never decrease below Basic Protection (Level 1)
6. Never exceed Maximum Protection (Level 4)

OUTCOMES:
- Maximum Protection (Level 4): Comprehensive protection with all measures
- High Protection (Level 3): Strong protection with most measures
- Standard Protection (Level 2): Normal protection with standard measures
- Basic Protection (Level 1): Minimal protection with essential measures
```

## 2. Scope Boundary Enforcement

2.1. Scope Definition Framework:
   - In-Scope Items: Explicitly define all components, files, or functionality to be modified
   - Out-of-Scope Items: Explicitly define all components, files, or functionality that must NOT be modified
   - Authorization Levels: Define permitted modification types for each in-scope component
   - Modification Restrictions: Define specific limitations on permitted changes
   - Approval Requirements: Define required approval for specific modification types

2.2. Boundary Enforcement Decision:
   - Component explicitly in scope + Modification type authorized + Within defined restrictions + Required approval obtained → MODIFICATION PERMITTED
   - Component explicitly in scope + Modification type authorized + Within defined restrictions + Required approval NOT obtained → SEEK APPROVAL FIRST
   - Component explicitly in scope + Modification type authorized + Exceeds defined restrictions → MODIFICATION PROHIBITED
   - Component explicitly in scope + Modification type NOT authorized → MODIFICATION PROHIBITED
   - Component explicitly OUT of scope → MODIFICATION PROHIBITED
   - Component not explicitly defined + Reasonable extension of in-scope component → SEEK APPROVAL
   - Component not explicitly defined + Unrelated to defined scope → MODIFICATION PROHIBITED
   - Required for in-scope functionality but not explicitly defined → SEEK EXPLICIT APPROVAL

2.3. Scope Exception Handling:
   - Production environments → NO EXCEPTIONS without documented approval
   - Security-critical components → NO EXCEPTIONS
   - Data integrity systems → NO EXCEPTIONS
   - READ ONLY components → ONLY with EXPLICIT human approval
   - Components with specific restrictions → ONLY with human approval
   - Adjacent components required for implementation → MAY be permitted with standard approval
   - Minor extensions to in-scope components → MAY be permitted with standard approval

2.4. Scope Verification Requirements:
   - Pre-implementation → Verify scope definition completeness
   - Before each change → Verify against scope boundaries
   - When approaching boundaries → Seek explicit approval
   - After implementation → Verify no out-of-scope modifications occurred

### Scope Boundary Decision Process

```
DECISION [D-SCOPE-1]: Is this modification within scope boundaries?

FACTORS:
- Component Status: [In-scope/Out-of-scope/Undefined]
- Modification Type: [Type of change being made]
- Authorization Level: [Level of permitted changes]
- Restrictions: [Any specific restrictions]
- Approval Status: [Approval obtained/needed]

PROCESS:
1. Check if component is explicitly in-scope (2.1)
2. Verify modification type is authorized (2.1)
3. Confirm modification is within defined restrictions (2.1)
4. Verify required approval has been obtained (2.1)
5. Apply boundary enforcement decision (2.2)
6. Handle exceptions appropriately (2.3)

OUTCOMES:
- MODIFICATION PERMITTED: Proceed with implementation
- SEEK APPROVAL FIRST: Obtain required approval before proceeding
- MODIFICATION PROHIBITED: Do not proceed with modification
- SEEK EXPLICIT APPROVAL: Obtain special approval for boundary case
```

## 3. Change Safety Controls

3.1. Change Risk Assessment:
   - Production Environment [ENV-PROD] → Critical/High Risk [ref: decision-tree-standard-factors.md#1.1]
   - Multiple Interacting Components → Higher Risk Level [ref: decision-tree-standard-factors.md#2.1]
   - Core Business Logic → Higher Risk Level
   - Data Structure Changes → Higher Risk Level
   - Interface Modifications → Higher Risk Level
   - Security-Related Changes → Critical Risk [ref: decision-tree-standard-factors.md#3.1]
   - Isolated Changes → Lower Risk Level
   - Well-Tested Patterns → Lower Risk Level
   - Documentation Changes → Low Risk [ref: decision-tree-standard-factors.md#3.4]

3.2. Safety Measure Determination:
   - Critical Risk [RISK-CRIT] → Comprehensive safety measures [ref: decision-tree-standard-factors.md#3.1]
   - High Risk [RISK-HIGH] → Enhanced safety measures [ref: decision-tree-standard-factors.md#3.2]
   - Medium Risk [RISK-MED] → Standard safety measures [ref: decision-tree-standard-factors.md#3.3]
   - Low Risk [RISK-LOW] → Basic safety measures [ref: decision-tree-standard-factors.md#3.4]

3.3. Implementation Safety Controls:
   - Incremental Changes: Implement changes in small, verifiable increments
   - Snapshot Verification: Create component snapshots before modifications
   - Reversibility: Ensure changes can be reversed if issues occur
   - Testing: Implement appropriate testing for the change type
   - Isolation: Minimize impact on other components
   - Documentation: Document the changes and verification approach

3.4. Post-Change Verification:
   - Comprehensive Verification: For Critical/High Risk changes
   - Standard Verification: For Medium Risk changes
   - Basic Verification: For Low Risk changes
   - Component-Specific Verification: For protected components
